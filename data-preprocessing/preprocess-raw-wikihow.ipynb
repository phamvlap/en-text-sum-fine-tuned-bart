Paints should be kept with brushes, cleaner, and canvas, print supplies should be by the ink, etc. Make broader groups and areas for your supplies to make finding them easier, limiting your search to a much smaller area. Some ideas include:\n","\n","\n","Essential supplies area -- the things you use every day.\n","Inspiration and reference area.\n","Dedicated work area .\n","Infrequent or secondary supplies area, tucked out of the way.;\n",", This doesn't mean cleaning the entire studio, it just means keeping the area immediately around the desk, easel, pottery wheel, etc. clean each night. Discard trash or unnecessary materials and wipe down dirty surfaces. Endeavor to leave the workspace in a way that you can sit down the next day and start working immediately, without having to do any work or tidying.\n","\n","\n","Even if the rest of your studio is a bit disorganized, an organized workspace will help you get down to business every time you want to make art.\n","\n",", As visual people, a lot of artist clutter comes from a desire to keep track of supplies visually instead of tucked out of sight. By using jars, old glasses, vases, and cheap, clear plastic drawers, you can keep things in sight without leaving it strewn about haphazardly. Some ideas, beyond those just mentioned, include:\n","\n","\n","Canvas shoe racks on the back of the door\n","Wine racks with cups in each slot to hold pens/pencils.\n","Plastic restaurant squirt bottles for paint, pigment, etc., Simply string up the wires across a wall or along the ceiling and use them to hold essential papers that you don't want to cut or ruin with tacks or tape. Cheap and easy, this is also a good way to handle papers and ideas you touch regularly or need to pin up and down for inspiration., Shelving is an artist's best friend and is a cheap and easy way to get more room in your studio or art space. Don't be afraid to get up high either, especially for infrequently used supplies. The upper reaches of the room are often the most under-utilized, but provide vital space for all your tools and materials., Turning one wall into a chalkboard gives you a perfect space for ideas, sketches, and planning without requiring extra equipment or space. You can even use it for smaller areas. Paint over jars or storage equipment, allowing you to relabel them with chalk as your needs change.\n","\n",", A lot of disorganization comes when you keep moving the location of things, trying to optimize your space by reorganizing frequently. This usually has the opposite effect, leading to lost items and uncertainty when cleaning, but an afternoon with a label maker can solve everything. Instead of spending all of your mental energy looking for or storing things, you can just follow the labels, freeing your mind to think about art., Once a month, do a purge of your studio. If it isn't essential or part of a project, either throw it out or file it away for later. Artists are constantly making new things, experimenting, and making a mess. This is a good thing, but only if you set aside time to declutter. It may not be fun at the moment, but it is a lot more fun than spending 30 minutes digging through junk to find the right paint or an old sketch.\n","\n","\n","Don't be sentimental here. If you haven't used it in the last six months there is little chance you'll use it in the next six months. Toss it.\n","\n","\n","Headline: \n","Keep related supplies in the same area.,\n","Make an effort to clean a dedicated workspace after every session.,\n","Place loose supplies in large, clearly visible containers.,\n","Use clotheslines and clips to hang sketches, photos, and reference material.,\n","Use every inch of the room for storage, especially vertical space.,\n","Use chalkboard paint to make space for drafting ideas right on the walls.,\n","Purchase a label maker to make your organization strategy semi-permanent.,\n","Make a habit of throwing out old, excess, or useless stuff each month.\n","EXAMPLE 1-TH:\n","Title: How to Create a Neopoprealist Art Work\n","Text:  See the image for how this drawing develops step-by-step. However, there is an important detail: the following drawings are to examine it, and then, to create something unique.\n","\n","\n","Use the lines to create the image shape and sections.\n","Fill appeared sections with different patterns/ ornaments.\n","Add text if needed, for example \"NeoPopRealism is 25!\"\n","Add a colored strip on the top, any color you wish.;\n",", Painting a mural always requires some preparation. You‘ll need equipment and effort, but planning and attention to detail will help you succeed. Painting a mural requires a suitable location, with the right surface that can be painted.\n","\n","This surface should be smooth and flat. However, even rough-textured surfaces can be used for your NeoPopRealist mural project.\n","\n",", For exterior projects that last for years, using a newer 100% acrylic exterior paint would be your best choice. For interior walls, use latex paints. Latex offer easier cleanup and lower costs. By measuring the total wall area to be covered, the total amount of paint can be calculated, but since this mural painting requires two colors - white and black - figuring the actual area to be painted each color is necessary to allow purchasing the right amount of each one.\n","\n","Large walls backgrounds may be rolled or sprayed with a white paint sprayer, where details may be added with brushes.\n","Paints are sensitive to high temperatures, humidity, direct sunlight, however, the interior projects do not have many complications. In public places, keeping the mural protected may require attention. For that reason, if you make your NeoPopRealist mural dedicated to its 25-year anniversary in school or office, you can consider using varnish for your mural.\n","\n",", See sample above. The design will give you a sense of proportion. You will have unique requirements and elements., Use a sketch and measure at scale the distances and locations of various points of your subject. Measuring key features will help you calculate the amount of paint when each feature is identified by its color., If the surface is low, the whole mural can be painted standing on the ground or from a stepladder. For higher work, you may have to rent a scaffold., Mark the horizontal and vertical lines., Use white paint as background., Then begin marking, using your scaled sketch, the location of key elements of objects, located in the foreground. Everything depends on the complexity of your mural. If you are confident in your artistic results, you may choose to draw all of the details in freehand., Be careful, keep clean transition edges from one color (black) to another (white). However, mistakes can be touched up later. Always allow fresh color to dry before proceeding to the drawing., An example would be painting a large patterns use big brushes, limbs, use small brushes for tiny and detailed patterns., If you have a drip or run, paint over it with the color paint appropriate for that location.

All pets require time, money, and love in addition to the specific needs of each animal and breed. You need to be sure you want a pet not just that day but in the long-term.   Most pets require attention and maintenance during the day, so make sure you'll be home enough to take care of your pet. If you have kids, consider what pets will be kid friendly. Hamsters and fish, for example, make great early pets. If you plan on moving or making large lifestyle changes you shouldn't consider a pet until you are more stable. ; , Even different types of dogs have different needs, so make sure you pick a pet that suits your means. Before buying a pet do thorough research on the behaviors and needs of various pets you like. Don't go into this decision dead-set on one species or breed -- being open-minded can lead to happy surprises and the right pet for your family. Keep in mind some general concerns with different pets:    Dogs - though dogs vary widely by breed, all dogs need lots of attention, time to exercise, and plenty of room to roam.  Cats - Intelligent and individual, cats will be fine with less supervision, though they still need your love and time to keep from acting out.  Hamsters, Gerbils, Ferrets, and Rodents - Economical and short-living, rodents make good first pets. They often, however, have strong odors.  Fish - Fish need careful monitoring and care to thrive, and won't cuddle anytime soon. Think of having a fish like having a garden.  Lizards - Happy on their own and generally easy to care for, lizards do not offer much affection and can be difficult to diagnose when sick.  Birds - Birds can be incredibly messy and are often loud. They are also expensive and occasionally temperamental, especially bigger birds like parrots.  , Curious, food-driven, and unable to listen to your warnings, pets can get into trouble if you don't create boundaries or safe spaces. Birds may dart out of open windows, lizards can scamper around the house, and dogs or cats may run into the street. Take note of openings your pet could accidentally escape through and make sure you can keep food out of their reach.   Remove any harmful objects like knives or poisonous food. If you want your animal to have outside time, consider putting in a fence. Put aside one room that you can designate as the pet's \"bedroom.\" Aim to adopt your pet during a relatively quiet time in your life so that everyone can avoid undue stress while getting used to each other.  , Talk to the pet store attendants or adoption agencies about things you'll need -- housing, toys, grooming supplies, etc. -- and shop before you bring your new pet home. Teach your family members how to use everything so that everyone is on the same page.   If you have young children you can help them prepare for pet care by \"feeding\" a doll or regularly watering plants.  , Pets are not ultra expensive, but that doesn't mean you won't need to spend money. Below are some annual cost estimates provided by the ASPCA:    Dogs-- $600-$900, depending on size  Cats-- $600  Rabbit-- $700  Rodents--$300-$650, depending on size  Fish -- $40 Small Birds -- $400  Large Birds (Parrots, Macaws)-- $700-$1,200 Set aside a few hundred dollars in case of emergency veterinary costs.  , Be sure to bring your pet to the vet soon after adopting it as well. Just like humans, pets need regular check-ups to spot problems before they become serious conditions. Use your first visit to discuss how often you should schedule check-ups and your pet's dietary and medical needs.   Be sure to schedule shots and vaccinations as soon as you can. Ask your vet what symptoms to look for if your pet gets sick. Spay or neuter dogs and cats to prevent pet over-population. Record your vet's number as well as the number of a veterinary hospital in case of emergencies.  , The cheapest food you find may not always be the healthiest. Feeding animals table scraps - no matter how cute they are when they beg - is not a good idea since people food often has minerals and items in it that can be harmful to our animal friends. Only feed your pet appropriate foods and give them responsible portions.   Research or ask your vet about good food sources and portion sizes. Natural foods, though more expensive, are healthier than dry or processed foods. , Though this is certainly true of dogs and cats, even fish and lizards require dedication and love to really thrive. Animals are social beings much like humans, and you need to set aside time to play with your pets so they get exercise and mental stimulation.   Give your pet room to roam -- the bigger the animal, the more room they'll need. Buy toys and play-sets for you and your pet to use together. Give your pet the occasional treat after good behavior to motivate it and cement good habits.  , This will keep both you and your pet healthy and happy. Create a regular cleaning schedule, at least once every 2-3 weeks, and stick to it, cleaning your animal and it's living spaces to prevent disease and odor.   For larger pets like cats and dogs, there are animal cleaning centers with large tubs and hoses. Keep up with regular grooming, such as brushing fur or scrubbing scales, every few days. For dogs and cats, make sure you keep their nails short so they don't break painfully. , While these steps are general guidelines for pet ownership, each animal is different and you need to adapt accordingly. Ask friends who have similar pets, check out books from the library, and search internet discussion boards about your breed or species. You can never know too much.   Be flexible once you bring your pet home. Pets have personalities and will have different wants and needs.\n","Headline: Determine if you can adequately care for a pet.  Choose a pet that fits your lifestyle.  Prepare your house for your incoming pet.  Buy necessary pet supplies in advance.  Budget enough money for adequate care.  Schedule regular visits to the vet.  Make sure your new \"family member\" has food that suits their nutritional needs.  Give your pet your affection and attention.  Clean your pet and all of its enclosures.  Do in-depth research about care for your pet.\n","AFTER CLEANING:\n","Text: It is critical that you do adequate research before buying the pet. Different animals have different needs regarding care (for example, tropical fish cannot be treated the same way as cold water fish), and even within the same species, different breeds can have different needs.   If you are buying a dog, then buying a high energy, large breed such as a wolfhound would be unsuitable if you live in a small apartment or spend all day at work and have nowhere to let the dog roam in the day. Focus on the pet's needs, not your wants.If you want an animal like a snake instead, research is still important. It is critical that the snake has enough space to crawl around in and a heat source (such as a lightbulb). If you're leading an active life, choose a dog. If you are away from home a lot, though, choose a cat or some other free-roaming animal. If you just want an animal to look at and don't want to interact with it directly, or don't have lots of time, choose a fish or a snake, or other creepy-crawlies.; , It’s a mistake to just decide “I want a dog” (or any other animal) and to buy the animal without considering the needs and requirements of the breed.   Some breeds are natural shepherds, which makes them great for 1 person, but some breeds (Border Collie, for example) have the sheep-herding instinct in their blood. This means that when a child roams too far from the rest of the \"herd,\" the collie will try to get it back. How does it do it with the sheep? It bites them. This may result in grave injuries to children. Please do your research on how breeds behave. It is important that a pet lives in an environment where it will be comfortable, safe and provided with what it needs. Some animals are very adaptable, such as cats, which can live happily in environments ranging from farm land to city centers, while others have more specific needs. For example, horses must have a lot of pastureland and somewhere safe to shelter. For animals that will roam the house, not being confined to tanks or cages, they will need places to sleep that are out of the way of general household traffic, where they can lie without being disturbed, such as the corner of a room. If they are a cat that will often be shut indoors, then it is also important that they have a litter tray that is regularly cleaned out.  , Some pets are more expensive than other pets, and you need to be honest with yourself about whether you can afford the pet - and whether you have the time and maturity to handle it.   Costs associated with pets include set-up supplies. Depending on the kind of pet, you might need a crate, an aquarium, and leashes. Don’t forget the ongoing costs of caring for a pet. You need to factor in the cost of regular food purchases, but also whether you can afford to take your pet to the veterinarian for preventative care (like shots), not just emergency care. That's essential to keep the pet healthy, and it can be quite costly.  , Figure out the exercise needs (if any) of the pet before you buy it, and consider whether your lifestyle gives you enough time to meet them.Some pets don't require you to do much beyond providing them with a safe place to move about, such as buying a run for a rabbit, and making sure the tank is large enough for fish. But other pets must be exercised. Dogs require a more hands-on approach to exercise because they need to be walked regularly. Making sure your pet gets enough exercise can help prevent aggression and destructive behaviors.  , Many foods that are edible for humans can be inappropriate for animals, making them ill when they consume them, so it is important to research what foods your pet can not eat as well as those they can eat.   Overfeeding is as harmful as underfeeding, so it is important that your pet gets the amount of food it needs and not too much extra. For some animals, dietary requirements may change with the season; for example, if you have horses or other grazing animals, they will often require more hay during the seasons when there is less grass. Look at pet food labels to make sure you are purchasing food for your pet that is properly nutritious. Research which food could harm your pet. It is vital that all pets have a constant water supply. Check water bowls at least once a day to ensure that they have enough water and that the water is clean and not contaminated.  , Many animals will largely take care of themselves, only really needing to be groomed or bathed when they manage to get very messy. Others, such as long-haired dogs or cats, may need regular grooming.   It is a good idea to desensitize your pet to being groomed or bathed from an early age. When brushing fur, ensure any brush used on the face is soft, and if brushing long, tangled fur, take the time to work out knots gently rather than tugging. You can buy brushes for pets at pet stores. When bathing your pet, make sure that the water is lukewarm and that the products you use do not cause an allergic reaction - buying specialist shampoos is not always necessary, but heavily perfumed products may cause a rash for many animals. Consider taking your pet to a professional groomer if you aren’t sure you are competent to do it. You don’t want to accidentally injure the pet.  , As pets cannot tell us when they are ill or injured, it is up to us to keep an eye on them and look out for any signs of injury.   Knowing your pet's normal behavior is very important; if they are sick or injured, they will often act unusually, such as sleeping more, going off their food, etc. If they begin to act oddly, check them for any injuries and keep an eye on their food and water intake; if they stop eating or drinking, or they have obvious wounds that are concerning you, then take them to the vet. Make sure that your pet has all of the proper vaccines and other preventative medication suggested by your veterinarian, such as heart worm pills for some dogs.  , A major part of caring for a pet is training. Training is essential for the safety of the animal and the people who interact with it.If you have an apartment cat, the litter box is very important from the start. You have to teach your cat to use the litter box and to think of it as its only place to do the necessary business.The litter box needs frequent cleaning (once or twice a day, depending on the cat).Feeding is approximately 2 or 3 times a day, again, depending on the cat. Water should be supplied continuously. Dogs need to be trained so they understand proper behavior, such as where to go to the bathroom and not to jump on people when they enter the house. It’s important that the owner establishes control, but never in an abusive or harmful way to the animal.  , Some animals require more attention than others, so the amount of time they need is often relative. Just be sure than you are capable of fulfilling whatever that need may be.   Try to take a little time out of each day to spend with your pet, even if it's just sitting down with them. More often than not, your pet would be more than happy to relax with you. Dogs should be walked, and hamsters need time to run around in their balls.Play should be fun for both your pet and you, but make sure it is safe and monitored at all times. Research whether your pet breed needs to socialize with other animals. Play with it - dogs are very social animals so they need to spend time with their owners. With toys or simply chasing him around is enough for exercising. Dogs have a natural craving for chewing things, so buy a chewing toy to keep him entertained.  , Love is what your relationship with your pet has to be about. Show him or her your affection by petting and playing.   Your pet will be a member of your family, so treat it like one. A good cuddle will do the both of you good. Pets respond to the tone of people's voices as well as touch. Horses need attention. Like wild horses, if you don't love them properly, they pretty much turn into mustang. Give them a treat once in a while, take a walk with them, or ride them for fun. Train a pet with positive reinforcement, never cruelty or abuse.Keep your pet and its environment clean. If you have a small animal, clean their cage weekly. You're not showing your pet love if you let it sit in filth. If you have a dog, vacuum fur regularly from the house and wash their dog bed from time to time. Neglecting to clean your pet could result in infection, so keep on top of its cleanliness.\n","Headline: Research the type of pet, so you can make sure the pet fits into your environment and lifestyle.  Choose your breed carefully, especially if you have children.  Be realistic about your budget, and your ability to shoulder responsibilities.  Exercise your pet if it’s the kind of pet that needs it, such as a dog.  Watch your pet’s diet carefully.  Consider whether your pet needs to be groomed.  Monitor your pet for illness and injury.  Train your pet if it’s the kind of pet that needs it.  Make time for your pet.  Love your pet.\n","AFTER CLEANING:\n","Text: You must always keep in mind that your pet has feelings. Just like you, they want freedom, good food, entertainment and may have acute feelings like sorrow, happiness etc. A pet may not be a human but it's feelings and needs are very similar. They may not be able to express their feelings to us but they feel just like us and they enjoy and suffer, just like you and me.; , It is your duty and responsibility to see that they don't feel as if they are different or that they suffer from loneliness or sorrow. You must take and treat them as a family member, loving and caring for them as if it was brother, sister, son or daughter.  , Read and learn about your pet. This way you will be able to understand his or her needs. Try to understand his or her body language. Spending more time with him or her will strengthen your relationship and allow you to understand your pet better. A pet who is comfortable in new surroundings will not be active and may be defensive/aggressive. These pets are ideal for families or the elderly. On the other hand, curious and active personalities are not submissive and are ideal for families without children below 10 years old.  , Unless your pet will be alone for a long period pf time, examples would be for an entire day or a few days at length.  , Allow your pet to enjoy his freedom. Don't disturb his or her sleep and try not to leave them in a closed atmosphere .  , Allow your pet to come in contact that is harmful, try not to disturb as he might have a reason but he is unable to express it.\n","Headline: Remember that they too are living things.  (If small animal) Don't make them live in a small cage choose a big cage, or even make one!  , Treat them like your family.  Understand them.  Take control of their stuff, rather than hiring a person to look after them.  Give them freedom.  Let them do what they want.\n","AFTER CLEANING:\n","Text: Not only do you need to make a nice living space for your animals before you even get them; but you need to follow and, most often, exceed local or federal laws about minimally required spaces for each species.   Depending on the type of exotic pet, find an empty pasture or clear a space on your property that's about one acre long. Fence the area and remove any hazardous items. Buy or make a gate for the front of the pasture. Then build a shelter for them to sleep and escape from rain, hail, snow and other adverse weather conditions. Make sure it's the right height, especially for a llama! a good house for an exotic animal is about 10 feet (3.0 m) by ten feet. Several animals can fit in it! It's easier to make it a three-sided house so you don't have to mess with a door.; , This includes a place to store the food, like a new metal trash can, something to carry the food in, like a pitcher, and a hay feeders with several areas for eating with trays underneath to put the food in. You can make one yourself or buy one at a farm store.  , Buy a padlock and secure the gate on the pasture. Always keep the key in the same place, and check the lock after each time you feed the animals.  , Make sure it doesn't have any cracks or holes in it, rinse it out with a hose, and watch your animals sip their drinks! These should be emptied of contaminated water away from feeding areas, scrubbed clean all over with a small amount of bleach and a stiff brush, rinsed until you can no longer taste or smell any trace of bleach or fecal matter whatsoever, and refilled with clean, pure water.  , Clean the droppings out of the pasture, animal housing, common areas and, especially, feeding areas daily with a rake and snow shovel, dumping it into a wheelbarrow. Then rinse any wooden or paved areas with water and squeegee the area dry. Don't make your animal(s) sleep or live on wet floors no matter what the season. Clear away all food left out the previous day from all areas before putting out fresh food and water. Carefully clean all water containers that might have gotten droppings, food, or other contamination in them.  , Pet them every day and give them hugs and kisses. Gently brush their fur and feed them out of your hand. Make sure your animal(s) have lots of safe, interesting toys and other enrichment like new things to smell or play with everyday. Don't leave enrichment with an animal for more than 3 -4 days at a time and clean all toys, etc. thoroughly with a small amount of bleach, lots of water, and a stiff brush before storing it or giving it to any other animal. Caring for exotic animals of any species is very hard work but, when done with dedication and love can be a great experience for you and your animals.  , If it bites, approach it carefully.\n","Headline: Make a living space for them.  Get feeding supplies.  Secure the area.  Buy a water tank.  Be prepared to clean droppings.

Water keeps bodies at the correct temperature and removes toxins that are the inevitable result of metabolism and industrial life. You'll be healthier automatically.   Water also clears your skin, helps your kidneys, helps to control your appetite, and keeps you energized.If being healthier, more wakeful, and having better skin isn't motivation, what is? It also keeps you from drinking unhealthy beverages like soda and juice, which are high in calories. The body barely registers the intake of these unhealthy drinks and yet you still feel thirsty hundreds of calories later. If you need the taste, splash some lemon, lime, or 100% juice into your water. However, be sure that you eat plenty of calcium-rich foods, such as broccoli, to support healthy bones as you grow older.; , A light, healthy breakfast is sufficient enough to reap the benefits of eating early. If it's comprised of lean protein and whole grains, then it will keep you from gorging at lunch. Research shows that breakfast-skippers actually eat more! So, to curb your appetite, don't skip the first meal of the day.   Instead of two chocolate doughnuts and a coffee that's more cream than anything else, opt for eggs, fruit, and for a beverage, skimmed milk, fresh orange juice, or tea. The healthier your breakfast is, the more energized you'll feel throughout the day and the more you won't need to eat later in the day. If half of your plate is vegetables and fruit, you're on the right track.Add in lean protein, low-fat dairy, and whole grains. Once a steady eating pattern has been established, your body will feel more comfortable. There may be a period of time when your body is wondering where the sugary foods went, but once you're over the hump, you'll feel better than ever.   Remember that not all fats are bad for you. Good fats can be found in oily fish like salmon and tuna, avocados, nuts, and olive oil. These are essential to a well-balanced diet. Read How to Eat Healthy for more tips.  , A good time for a healthy, easy-to-digest evening meal is between 17:00 and 20:00; it's best to avoid late night snacks because they fill you with unnecessary calories and can disrupt your sleep. If you do need that midnight snack, stick to unsalted nuts, seeds, fruits, and veggies.   Snacking isn't bad for you if you do it right. In fact, eating \"constantly\" can keep you from feeling deprived and going for that third piece of cheesecake when the cart rolls around. Just make sure it's all in moderation. In case you haven't noticed, meat hasn't played much of a role in what we've talked about so far. Being vegetarian is a good way to reduce your calorie intake and get loads of vitamins and minerals, but that being said, it can be done wrong. While it's not the best idea to go fully vegetarian, most people do eat far too much meat. A good idea is to change the amount and types of meat you eat: swap pork chops for lean chicken; steak for tuna.   A high-fiber diet is easily had without meat. Fiber has been shown to lower your cholesterol, control your blood-sugar levels, improve your bowel health, and make you less likely to overeat. The recommended fiber intake is 30g a day for men and 21g for women; after the age of 50, this jumps up to 38g for men and 25g for women. Some good sources of fiber include fruits and vegetables (with the skin), whole grains, and legumes. Processed foods get a bad rap, and often for good reason. However, you've got to choose your battles. That frozen bag of broccoli isn't nearly as bad as that boxed mac and cheese.
