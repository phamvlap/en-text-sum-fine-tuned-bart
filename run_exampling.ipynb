    "as you start planning for project or work , you will likely be gathering scraps of inspiration and test sketches . while everyone has strategy , there is nothing more maddening than digging through book or the internet to re - find the cool idea you saw three months ago . try out dedicating notebook , preferably with insert folders , to each project . making bookmark folder for each project on your internet browser to easily compile online inspiration . tacking up physical inspiration on wall or cork board near your workspace . very few artists simply dive right into large projects . almost 100 of the time they instead work on related , smaller projects called studies to prepare for the larger work . you might practice the face of the portrait you are making , sketch our different composition ideas , or practice vulnerable or difficult part of sculpture . keep these organized as way to prepare both the skills , ideas , and supplies needed for the final project . at the end of the day , artists are visual people , and tucking everything away neatly and cleanly may not be conducive to the artistic process . of course , neither is losing or misplacing essential supplies . find compromise by packing away any supplies not currently in use , and leaving little bit of essential clutter . it is okay to have inspiration scattered around the studio - just make sure it is the inspiration you need for the current project . just because you are not organized is no excuse not to make an attempt . do not feel like the only options are perfect cleanliness or an utter mess - there is middle ground . nothing is worse than spending long night on painting only to realize you have run out of white paint halfway through section . once week , or more frequently if possible , check in on the quantities of your supplies so that you can refill them before it becomes problem . simple spreadsheet or notebook , marked at the end of each artistic session , is quick and easy way to keep tabs on your stuff . deciding to paint mural is huge undertaking . but sketching the idea , transposing the image onto the wall , painting the basic colors , then adding shading detail are four separate and more manageable projects . organization is key to big projects , even if it feels constraining to your creativity . in reality , organizing your work and progress frees your mind to actually be creative , instead of worrying about logistics . figure out the building blocks of each part of the project , tackling each at once . do not jump around across all parts of the project haphazardly .\n",

    "the best art investors do their research on the pieces of art that they buy , so someone with some education or interest in the art world is more likely to understand this niche market . as well as personal research , you will need to have contacts with people in the art world , such as auctioneers , gallery directors and dealers , who can give you good investment advice . you may confuse these three terms , if you are not careful . each of them has slightly different goal in mind when looking to buy art . art collectors do not buy art for investment purposes . they buy it to decorate and display in their home . because they consider them to be an important part of their home or life , most art collectors have hard time parting with pieces of their collection . while many collectors do end up selling some pieces of art , it may be done because of necessity . collectors often loan their works out to museums and occasionally donate them to museums upon their death . art investors seek to diversify their portfolio with an art investment . some investment firms put about two and half to three percent of their investment money in art . they seek good advice and often buy paintings that are older and have been popular historically , such as paintings by the old masters . these investments are kept over decades , and sold off when the market is right , with the investor seeking to get six to ten percent profit rise per year . these investments are also often made to be given as inheritance to future generations of the family . art investment is often undertaken by the very wealthy . art speculators try to invest in art that they believe will appreciate in value . they aim to buy art at low price from budding artists in the beginning of their careers . then they hope to sell their work in 10 to 15 years when the artists are at the peak of their careers and people or collectors are willing to pay much more for their pieces . this is type of investment that takes intimate involvement with the art world and liquidity in order to buy the art . art investments should be no more than small part of your investment portfolio , along with stocks , bonds , new businesses and more . figure out what your range is before you begin to pick out potential pieces , and get advice from investors and art dealers . study the mei moses fine art index to get firm grasp of the art market today . although they cannot predict what will be popular in the future , they can tell you what art tends to keep its value and be low - risk and what art has more volatile market value . while this is not an absolute rule to follow , paintings from successful artists tend to get better returns than sculpture and installation art . get all the information you can out of them before making purchase . if you are going to buy at auction , be prepared to walk away if the price goes higher than your investment range . beware of art auctioneers or dealers that promise too high return on paintings . in many ways , they are just like stock brokers and other financial investment firms , who may promise anything to get sale . they should be found trustworthy before you buy anything , because ponzi schemes and art market bubbles are part of this investment landscape as well . if you have never bought art in an auction environment before , you may want to seek advice about how it is done properly . you should study the auction booklet before hand , learn about secret buyers and how prices can quickly inflate . most fine auction houses would be willing to teach you the basics if they see you as serious investor . arrange for payment , shipping and insurance . each piece of art should be insured and catalogued as part of your estate . in order for an art investment to retain its value , it should be kept at low - humidity and avoid being marred . you may choose to hang it in your home , but you may want to get an art collector advice about where to hang it and how to care for it . share this information with your children , if it is intended as an inheritance investment . they need to be well aware of how to take care of art , or they may lose money or ruin the painting entirely . as well as keeping tabs on the art world to understand the rise and falls of certain schools of art , an appraiser can tell you how your investment is maturing . they may clue you in on when you have reached your desired profit . if the art you buy does not fit in your home , and you will only be storing it , research banks , hotels and other institutions that rent fine art on rotating basis . you may be able to demand thousands of dollars per year for your art to hang in another building . keep in mind you will need to make sure your art is covered by an insurance policy for loss or damage . make sure the renter provides insurance for your art . you should prepare contract that stipulates the time allotted , the fee , the insurance and the shipment of your art . unless you employ an art dealer or auction house at the exact moment when the art is in high value , it can take years and thousands of dollars in fees to find the right buyer .\n",

    "it is possible to become vfx artist without college degree , but the path is often easier with one . vfx artists usually major in fine arts , computer graphics , or animation . choose college with reputation for strength in these areas and reputation for good job placement for graduates . the availability of internships is another factor to consider . out of the jobs advertised for vfx artists , majority at any given time specify bachelor degree as minimum requirement for applicants . some studios offer short - term programs for people who want to learn more about vfx artistry without pursuing college degree . enrolling in these programs can be expensive as financial aid is not always offered , but they usually have the most cutting edge technology for you to learn from . although you may create some hand sketches , the majority of your work will be completed on the computer using the most up - to - date programs . stay informed about the newest software advances by following vfx blogs and taking online computer tutorials . for example , vfx artists are expected to be well - versed in graphics and animation programs , such as adobe creative suite and javascript . clearly list every program that you can work with on your resume . hop onto youtube or another video service and search for vfx clip reels or demonstrations . some of these videos will focus on particular skill set , such as shading , which you then can practice on your own . challenge yourself to mimic some of the more difficult tasks , or even try to improve upon the models used . take as many art and design classes as you can . or , simply carry sketch pad around with you to work on your basic animation skills . as you draw , consider factors such as lighting and framing . even geometry skills can come in handy when creating particular type of background or even person face . make choice to become an observer of the world around you . ask yourself how could capture the movement of the leaves or , in what situations do shadows appear , watch all of these creations with an eye for detail . look for the techniques used and any original approaches that you see . try to recreate any scenes that you find particularly interesting . research the artists and see what their backgrounds are and contact them if you like . as you gain more experience , you will likely find yourself gravitating toward certain aspect of design . this will become your calling card and directors and other professionals will seek you out for this type of work . to build your specialization , start choosing jobs with that emphasis and attend additional training seminars . for example , some vfx specialists focus on human character faces , animal figures , or city backgrounds .\n",

    "this will help you to know what is needed and the direction you want the room to take . having accents in your room will create the needed contrast and focal points . black is nice , stark contrast , which would make an even more elegant room , but you can use any colour you like the most . if you have dark room , you will need to layer many coats . use long , even strokes in all one direction , and do not touch the paint while it is drying . an antique or canopy bed in white would suit the theme nicely . get suitable bedspreads as well . you could use white or your chosen accent colour . again , an antique wood side table in white would suit the theme quite nicely . all furniture should be white or whitish , preferably antiques . you can paint wood white if needed . this should be white . you can put your books , dvds , and cds on them . this does not have to be antique , but crystal or fristal fake crystal would work very well . choose deep pile one that you can sink your feet into it when you get up in the morning . try rug in your accent colour . have it in white . place it beside your bed . they should be simple black velvet curtains held up by an accent colour ribbon . you could add wall mirror , wastebasket , etc . put them in black or silver frames . again , hang these in black and silver frames . your couch should be white leather , or pleather if you are vegan or cannot afford leather . put magazines and your favorite books on it . you could also have computer on there if you own one , or tv .\n",
